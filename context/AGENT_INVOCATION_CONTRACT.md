# Agent Invocation Contract

Every agent invocation in this repository MUST include:

1. `context/DECISION_LOGGING.md`
2. Any active Spec Packet or Patch Packet (verbatim)
3. A directive stating:
   “You must follow all instructions in the provided context files.”

Agents must treat these documents as authoritative runtime rules.

Failure to follow this contract is a workflow violation.
